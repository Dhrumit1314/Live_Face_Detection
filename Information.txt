Due to computational constraints, I was only able to train the model for 3 epochs instead of the intended 10. However, I have saved and uploaded the partially trained models. You can find these models in the respective repositories on my GitHub account.

The 'Models' repository contains the model trained for facial emotion, age, and gender detection. The 'Haarcascade Model' repository houses the pre-trained model for face detection. Please feel free to download and use these models from the provided repositories.

Please note that the training process is not yet complete, and the models will be updated as more epochs are completed. Your patience and understanding are greatly appreciated. Thank you!
